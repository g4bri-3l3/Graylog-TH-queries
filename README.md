# What

A list of queries to detect and hunt for threats written mostly for SPLUNK/Logscale/Graylog (but can be used with Lucene language based systems, too).

# How

Assuming you are using winlogbeat for log shipping. Just copy-paste the queries in the search bar or use them to create custom alerts (for instance: "alert me when you see a domain admin change").
