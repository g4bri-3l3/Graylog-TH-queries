# What

A list of queries to detect and hunt for threats written mostly for Splunk/Logscale/Graylog (but can be used with Splunk/Lucene language based systems, too).

NB: All the queries have been converted for Raport/Logscale release. If you encounter any issue, please ping me.

# How

Assuming you are using winlogbeat for log shipping. Just copy-paste the queries in the search bar or use them to create custom alerts (for instance: "alert me when you see a domain admin change").
