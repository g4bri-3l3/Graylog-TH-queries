# What

A list of queries to detect and hunt for threats written mostly for Logscale/Graylog (the ones for Graylog could be used with Splunk/Lucene based systems, too).

NB: I'm converting the queries from old language to Logscale language in free time. If you encounter any issue, please ping me. Also let me know if you are interested in knowledge exchange!

# How

- For Splunk: just copy-paste it
- For Logscale: just copy paste it
- For Graylog: I'm assuming you are using winlogbeat for shipping logs from Windows boxes here. Just copy-paste the queries in the search bar or use them to create custom alerts (for instance: "alert me when you see a domain admin change").
